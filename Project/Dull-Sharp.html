        <h1><b>Dull-Sharp</b></h1>
        <h3>Dull (Manda): predominantly composed of the Water and Earth elements, reduces the Vata and Pitta Doshas, and increases the Kapha Dosha. Due to the heavy nature of water and earth, substances with Manda tend to cause dullness and sluggishness in the system.

            Rich and fatty foods including milk, yogurt, meat, nutmeg possess ‘Manda’.</h3>
        <img src="https://sarveda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gunas_post_5.jpg" alt="Dull Sharp Qualities">
        <h3>Sharp (Tikshna): predominantly from the Fire element, increases the Pitta Dosha and reduces the Vata and Kapha Doshas.
            Substances with sharp penetrating qualities tend to coexist with hot qualities and together create cleansing effects on the body, known in Sanskrit as Shodhana. Sharp qualities provide the ability to penetrate and help to reduce any excess Kapha accumulated in the body. Foods with this quality also help in sharpening the intellect thereby improving learning, concentration, and understanding. 
            
            Sharp quality foods include spices, salt, pineapple, chillies and honey.</h3>
