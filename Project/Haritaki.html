        <p>Technically the fruit of the deciduous myrobalan plum tree, haritaki is considered an important herb in Ayurveda and Siddha medicine, both forms of indigenous medicine in India. The fruit itself is small, oblong, and less than an inch in size.</p>
        <p>The fruits are often collected when they’re still green and raw and then dried until golden brown or black. They’re then powdered and made into Ayurvedic remedies. The fruit’s potency is based on where the fruit was collected, its color, and its shape.

        </p>
        <p>
            Haritaki is also known as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                harad
            </li>
            <li>haradey</li>
            <li>kaddukki (in South Asia)</li>
            <li>kayakalpa</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In Tamil, it’s referred to as “kayakalpa,” a rejuvenator of the body that balances all dosha, or humors. It’s often referred to as a “life-giving” herb.

        <h2>Haritaki health benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Haritaki is prized in Ayurveda for its versatile health applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vrinda Devani, OB-GYN and Ayurvedic practitioner of Banyan Botanicals and Ayurprana says that haritaki balances all the elements, especially ether and air. The combination of ether and air is known as Vata dosha, which is said to cause 80 percent of all diseases in Ayurveda.
        </p>
        <p>
            Devani notes that haritaki is also high in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>    Vitamin C</li>
            <li>Vitamin K</li>
            <li>Magnesium</li>
            <li>Amino Acids</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practitioners of Ayurveda include it as part of treatment for a host of ailments, including both short-term and chronic health concerns.</p>
        <p>
            Haritaki is one part of the trifecta of the beneficial Ayurvedic blend, triphala, along with bibhitaki and amla, or Indian gooseberry.
        </p>
        <p>
            “To pacify the air element (Vata), take it with ghee, or clarified butter,” says Devani. “To pacify fire and heat (Pitta), you can take it with a little sugar. To pacify water and earth (Kapha), you can take it with a little rock salt.”
        </p>
        <p>
            According to a 2018 study, Ayurvedic researchers note that each of the different seven types of fruit are prescribed for specific ailments.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Devani and 2014 research, haritaki is beneficial for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>cough</li>
            <li>constipation, gas, and bloating</li>
            <li>indigestion</li>
            <li>detoxification</li>
            <li>weight loss</li>
            <li>skin disease</li>
            <li>metabolism</li>
            <li>immunity</li>
            <li>fertility</li>
            <li>libido</li>
            <li>cleansing</li>
            <li>supporting regular bowel movements</li>
            <li>nourishing and rejuvenating the tissues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“Haritaki is beneficial for a number of illnesses,” says Devani. “One of the unique things about haritaki is that as […] an herb that rejuvenates and nourishes all organs and tissues, it also supports immunity. It can support reproductive challenges like libido and fertility.”</p>
        <p>
            A 2017 pharmacological study of the extracts of the myrobalan fruit suggests that it contains several helpful compounds that support its application as an:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>anticarcinogenic</li>
            <li>antifungal</li>
            <li>antibacterial</li>
            <li>antioxidant</li>
            <li>antidiabetic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These also play a part in heart health, wound care, and digestive support.

            Haritaki beauty benefits for skin, hair, and nails
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a rejuvenating and regenerative herb with antioxidant properties, haritaki is believed to have the potential to improve the health of the skin, hair, and nails.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Skin
        </h2>
        <p>
            According to 2019 research, haritaki may help address a variety of skin ailments classified by Ayurveda.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Use it externally by making a paste with some water or rose water,” she says. “If it’s a little drying, add a few drops of oil.”

In a 2014 study, a haritaki paste created with haritaki powder, ghee, and water helped alleviate cracked feet.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Hair
        </h2>
        <p>A 2021 study notes that classical Ayurvedic texts include formulations for hair dyes using haritaki powder, noting these formulations have been used for generations with no adverse effects. The research also notes that haritaki not only darkens but softens hair.</p>
        <h2>
            Nails
        </h2>
        <p>
            A 2019 study noted that haritaki’s antimicrobial properties may be helpful in alleviating nailbed infection, though more high quality research is needed.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Spiritual benefits of haritaki
        </h2>
        <p>
            According to ancient Hindu scriptures called the Vedas, a drop of nectar fell from the celestial cup of Lord Indra and sprouted the haritaki tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name haritaki can be interpreted as “that which embodies Hari,” or Lord Shiva, one of three Hindu gods responsible for the creation, upkeep, and destruction of the world.
        </p>
        <p>As a cleansing and restorative herb, it’s included in holistic health care to address dosha imbalances. Many believe it plays a role in spiritual balance as well.</p>
<p>
    In Buddhism, haritaki is called “Big Golden Fruit” and represents a connection to the Buddha. It’s believed to embody the core value of Buddhism, compassion.
</p>
<p>Haritaki is valued for its regenerative potential as a cure for many ailments. The Medicine Buddha, an important icon in Mahayana Buddhism, is depicted as holding a haritaki fruit in both hands.</p>
<h2>
