            <h1>Pitta Dosha</h1>
            <p>Pitta Dosha is a combination of Agni (Fire) and Jala (Water) elements and is responsible for heat generation within the body.It is primarily concerned with digestion and how the body processes and utilizes consumed food. This Dosha governs the body's metabolism, or the rate at which energy is burned or heated.</p>

            <h1>Qualities of Pitta:</h1>
            <p>Chapter 1 of the Ashtanga Hrudaya Suta Sthana states (in Sanskrit):
                “पित्तं सस्नेह तीक्ष्णोष्णं लघु विस्रं सरं द्रवम् ।”
                pittam sasneha tīksnosņam laghu visram saram dravam |
                Pitta is characterised by qualities such as Sasneha: slightly oily, unctuous, Teekshna (penetrating into deep tissue), Ushna (hotness), Laghu (lightness), Visram (bad odour), Sara (fluidity and movement), and Drava (liquidity).
                Pitta regulates the entire digestive process, from consumption to development. Pitta also regulates colour perception, sweating, and body temperature. An imbalance in Pitta can cause serious problems with self-esteem, memory, energy, and overall intelligence. This Dosha is required for the proper functioning of body functions that require energy.
                Samsarga refers to an increase or decrease in individual Doshas, whereas Sannipata denotes an imbalance of all three Doshas.</p>

            <h1>Balanced and Imbalanced Pitta Dosha</h1>
            <p>These are some of the most significant Pitta dosha characteristics. Now, let's look at some of the differences you'll notice in your mind and body when the Pitta dosha is balanced compared with when it's imbalanced.
                These are the qualities that a person exhibits when the Pitta Dosha is in balance.
                Sharp, almond-shaped eyes (usually green or hazel)
                Little body hair or soft and light body hair.
                High hairline, medium amount of soft hair; in the ageing process, thinning hair to male pattern baldness.
                Sharp nose, teeth, and chin.
                Freckles (reddish hair is also pitta-quality).
                Medium-to-small height
                Joints are flexible.
                Symmetry of hips and shoulders
                The tongue is coloured red.
                Rosy cheeks and lips.

                <h1>How to determine your Dosha type?</h1>
                <p>1. The patient's external characteristics and a conversation with their doctor can provide an initial sign.<br>
                    2. Ayurvedic pulse diagnosis (Nadi Vigyan) can be used by doctors to learn more about the dosha constellation.<br>
                    3. The patient's organ condition, as well as any potential disorders, can all help with diagnosis.<br>
                    4. Ayurvedic tongue diagnosis assists the doctor in determining any dosha imbalances and digestive issues.<br>
                    5. Only an experienced Ayurvedic doctor can diagnose the dosha constitution. They can also determine the appropriate treatment.</p>

            <h1>Pitta dosha treatment in Ayurveda </h1>
            <p>Stay cool. Avoid hot weather, food, and spicy meals.<br>
                Try to avoid overworking and find balance in your daily routine.<br>
                Avoid skipping meals.<br>
                Eat three filling meals per day, around the same time every day.<br>
                Make sure your largest meal of the day occurs at noon when your digestive fire is strongest.<br>
                Give yourself an ABHYANGA (self-massage with warm oil) every day before bathing, using a cooling oil like coconut.<br>
                Meditation can help reduce mental stress.<br>

        <h1> Certain herbs can be very beneficial in managing the Pitta imbalance in your body:</h1>
        <p>Amla (Amalaki) is excellent for balancing Pitta, especially in the digestive system. Amla can be consumed directly or through supplements like Triphala or effervescent tablets.<br>
            Guduchi helps control excess Pitta, with its bitter properties making it suitable for Pitta management.<br>
            Guduchi can be taken naturally or as Guduchyadi Kwath.<br>
            Triphala, a mix of three fruits, assists in managing high Pitta dosha.<br>
