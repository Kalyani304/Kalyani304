            <h1>Qualities of Kapha :</h1>
            <p>According to the Ashtanga Hrudaya Suta Sthana, Chapter 1 (Sanskrit):
                स्निग्धः शीतो गुरुर्मन्दः श्लक्ष्णो मृत्स्नः स्थिरः कफः ॥
                snigdha: śīto gururmanda: ślakşno mrtsna: sthira: kapha: ||
                Kapha's attributes include Snigdhna, which is oily and unctuous, Sheeta, which is cold, Guru, which is heavy, Manda, which is gentle and sticky, Shlakshna, which is smooth and clear, Mrutsna, which is slimy and jelly-like, and Sthira, which is stable and immobile.
                It is in charge of binding the cells together, which form the body's muscles, fat, and bones. A Kapha-dominant individual is energetic and has a strong physique, stamina, and good digestion. However, an imbalance of Kapha Dosha causes difficulties such as weight gain, fluid retention, allergies, and weariness. People with this dosha have glossy and oily skin that is fair and cold due to the qualities of the water element. Kapha hair is typically strong, coarse, and curly. It can even cause asthma, sleep problems, diabetes, and depression.  
                Samsarga denotes an increase or decrease in individual Doshas,. And Sannipata points to an imbalance of all three Doshas.</p>
