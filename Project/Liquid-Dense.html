        <h3>Dense (Sandra): composed of the earth element, increases the Kapha Dosha and reduces the Vata and Pitta Doshas. Because of their concentrated nature, they promote groundedness and stability. They also promote solidity and growth of healthy tissues.Substances with dense quality include cheese and roots.</h3>

        <h3>Liquid (Drava): Drava is the opposite of Sandra hence it means less concentrated or diluted. Composed of the fire and water elements, increases the Pitta and Kapha Doshas and reduces the Vata Dosha. Drava provides hydration which moistens the body and facilitates the excretion of waste.

            ‘Drava’ substances include water, yogurt, cherries, grapes, peaches and sweet berries.
