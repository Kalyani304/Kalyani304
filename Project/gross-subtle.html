        <h1><b>Gross- Subtle</b></h1>
        <h3>Gross (Sthula): composed of the Earth element, increases the Kapha Dosha and reduces the Vata and Pitta Doshas. The action and effect of substances with gross quality support and protect the body. However, gross qualities do not move easily and do not penetrate deep in the tissue and therefore have the tendency to block channels. “Gross” substances are difficult to digest and can lead to obesity. 

            Substances having ‘gross’ quality include meat, Shilajit and mushroom.
            
            </h3>

        <h3>Subtle (Sukshma): composed of the Ether and Air elements, with a hint of the Fire element, increases the Vata and Pitta Doshas and reduces the Kapha Dosha.
            Subtle quality can penetrate deep small channels within the body reaching the smallest of all bodily tissues. Foods with ‘subtle’ qualities are easy to digest and can expand awareness and open spiritual dimensions. However, excess intake of subtle substances can cause depletion of bodily tissue or also cause spaciness in the mind. 
            
            Foods having ‘Sukshma’ include Brahmi, ghee, honey, alcohol, etc.</h3>
