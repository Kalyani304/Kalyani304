        <h1><b>Hot-Cold</b></h1>
        <h3>Cold (Sheeta): the water element tends to be exclusive to cold qualities, therefore increasing the Vata and Kapha Doshas and decreasing the Pitta Dosha.
            Substances with cold qualities have constricting and contracting effects on the body, which increases the compactness of bodily tissue. Foods that promote ‘Sheeta’ include wheat, milk, grapes, avocado, lime, celery, cabbage, herbs like neem, mint, juices, etc.
            
            </h3>

        <h3>Hot (Ushna): predominantly composed of the fire element, creates a burning sensation and heat within the body, leading to an increase in the Vata and Pitta Doshas and a decrease of the Kapha Dosha.
            The hot quality gives a therapeutic effect, usually manifesting in perspiration. It also helps relax by expanding channels and facilitating passage and movement within the body. It also enables the removal of waste from the body due to an increase in Agni or digestive fire. 
            
            Foods that promote ‘Ushna’ include garlic, ginger, black pepper, mustard seeds, chilli Peppers, alcohol, salt, onion, beef, honey, brown rice, lemon, etc.
