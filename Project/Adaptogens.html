            <p>Adaptogens or adaptogenic compounds are edible plants, medicinal mushrooms, herbs or other substances that hold a wealth of medicinal potential and are used in traditional medicine (particularly in parts of Asia and India) for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments.

                There are at least 70 types of herbal plants that are considered as adaptogens, and with so many adaptogens to choose from, it might be confusing.
                Mushrooms and herbs in this adaptogens list are mostly based on Dr. Israel Brekhman’s findings, who devoted 45 years of his life to research on tonic herbs, and became a global authority on adaptogens in the 1960s. Eventually, he earned the nickname the “Father of Adaptogens.</p>

                <p>
                    Adaptogens or adaptogenic compounds are plant substances (edible herbs, plants and medicinal mushrooms) that act as herbal remedies and have been found to help our bodies manage stress and sustain balance (homeostasis). Homeostasis refers to any process that all organisms use to actively maintain fairly stable conditions necessary for survival.

                If homeostasis is successful, life continues. If homeostasis is unsuccessful, it results in a disaster or death of the organism.

It’s because Reishi contains an enormous collection of bioactive polysaccharides, beta-glucans and more than 120 different triterpenoid compounds.</div>

                                As a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), this spice with a very strong aroma and bitter taste is similar to ginger root. Therefore, turmeric is very common in many Asian cuisines and it’s the spice that gives curry its yellow color. Though it is primarily used as a spice, at the same time it is one of the most well-known medicinal herbs. Turmeric has been used for thousands of years in traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine.Turmeric is now one of the most studied antioxidant herbs in the world. Curcumin is a principal curcuminoid and the main active ingredient in Turmeric, and piperine enhances the absorption of curcumin even by 2,000%. Therefore, the best curcumin supplements now contain piperine, which increases curcumin effectiveness.

Moreover, the piperine contained in pepper also has a bactericidal effect, it reduces appetite and improves mood. According to a study curcumin and piperine separately, and in combination could be potential cancer preventive agents (33). However, do not self medicate as more research is needed.
