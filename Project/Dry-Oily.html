        <h1><b>Dry-Oily</b></h1>
        <h3>Dry (Ruksha): predominantly composed of the air element, increases the Vata Dosha and decreases the Pitta and Kapha Doshas. Dry substances have the ability to absorb, and therefore create dryness and hardness within the body. ‘Dry’ also helps to loosen the body but also an excess of dryness can cause dehydration and exhaustion.

            Dry quality substances include rice-cakes, dry oats, broccoli, cabbage, celery, fresh corn, kale, cauliflower, honey, etc.</h3>

        <h3>Oily (Snigdha): predominantly composed of the water element, Snigdha increases Pitta and Kapha Doshas and decreases the Vata Dosha. Substances having an Oily quality strengthen body tissues given the similar consistency of oil and tissues. They also provide lubrication and compactness for the tissues, which in turn strengthen the body. 

            Oily quality substances include ghee, oil, fats, avocado, pork, black olives, warm milk, pomegranate, etc.</h3>
