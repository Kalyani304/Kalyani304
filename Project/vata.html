            <h1>Vata Dosha</h1>
            <p>Vata dosha is the Ayurvedic mind-body element associated with air and space. It’s light, cool, and dry in nature, and it governs all movement and processes in your mind and body—including processes like blood flow, elimination, breathing, and the movement of thoughts in your mind.</p>

                <h3>Vata dosha is one of the three doshas in Ayurveda, the traditional system of medicine that originated in India thousands of years ago. The doshas, which also include Pitta and Kapha, are fundamental energies that govern various bodily and mental functions. Vata is often described as the “wind” or “ether” dosha, as it embodies qualities such as lightness, mobility, and change.</h3></div>

            <h1>Qualities of Vata:</h1>
            <p>As the Ashtanga Hrudaya Suta Sthana, Chapter 1 quotes (Sanskrit):
                “तत्र रूक्षो लघुः शीत: खरः सूक्ष्मश्चलोऽनिलः ॥”
                tatra rūkso laghu: śīta: khara: sūkṣmaścalo'nila: ||
                Rooksha is dry, Laghu is light, Sheeta is cold, Khara is rough, Sookshma is minute, and Chala is movement. These are the characteristic qualities of Vata.
                Vata people are often small or thin, with dry skin and hair. They are sensitive to cold temperatures. They may experience cold extremities, circulation problems, and joint pain.
                Their personalities can be interesting, dynamic, and energetic. They are also thought to be creative, observant, and sensitive individuals.
                They are both physically and mentally active, often multitasking and speaking quickly.
                Vata people may be overwhelmed and have mood swings. When vata people become agitated, their emotions can appear as fear, anxiety, or nervousness.
                Samsarga refers to an increase or decrease in individual Doshas. Sannipata refers to an imbalance of all three Doshas.</p>
