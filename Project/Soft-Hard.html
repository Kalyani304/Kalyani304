        <h1><b>Soft-Hard</b></h1>
        <h3>Heavy quality tends to decrease both the <a href="https://sarveda.com/vata-dosha-the-energy-of-motion/">Vata</a> and <a href="https://sarveda.com/pitta-dosha-the-energy-of-change/">Pitta</a> Doshas and increase the <a href="https://sarveda.com/kapha-dosha-the-foundational-energy-of-life/">Kapha</a> Dosha. Guru, meaning dense, takes a considerable amount of energy to digest but also increases bodily tissues. If heavy foods are consumed regularly, it can weaken the digestive metabolic fire. Heavy quality substances include foods like milk, wheat, meat, cheese, buttermilk, brown rice, etc.Soft (Mrudu): composed of the water element, increases the Pitta and Kapha Doshas and decreases the Vata Dosha. ‘Soft’ creates tenderness and relaxation and just the thought of sleeping on soft, nice, fluffy pillows can create thoughts of comfort. However, an excess of soft quality not only increases mucus and phlegm but also flaccidity dislocation of joints.

            Foods having ‘soft’ quality include avocado, cucumber, green bananas, sweet potato, white rice and red lentil</h3>
