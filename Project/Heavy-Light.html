        <h1><b>Heavy – Light</b></h1>
        <h3>Heavy quality tends to decrease both the <a href="https://sarveda.com/vata-dosha-the-energy-of-motion/">Vata</a> and <a href="https://sarveda.com/pitta-dosha-the-energy-of-change/">Pitta</a> Doshas and increase the <a href="https://sarveda.com/kapha-dosha-the-foundational-energy-of-life/">Kapha</a> Dosha. Guru, meaning dense, takes a considerable amount of energy to digest but also increases bodily tissues. If heavy foods are consumed regularly, it can weaken the digestive metabolic fire. Heavy quality substances include foods like milk, wheat, meat, cheese, buttermilk, brown rice, etc.</h3>

        <h3>Light (Laghu): The Light quality tends to increase the Vata and Pitta Doshas and decrease the Kapha Dosha. Foods with ‘light’ quality are generally easy to digest and bring about a feeling of lightness to the body. Since it is the opposite quality to ‘heavy’, individuals suffering from obesity would benefit from taking ‘light’ quality substances. Lightness also tends to increase attentiveness and concentration; however, excess consumption of light substances can also create spaciness and ungroundedness, manifesting in feelings of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and insecurity.</h3>
        <h3>Light quality foods include berries, apples, cherries, rice-cakes, celery, corn, lettuce, artichoke, etc.</h3>
